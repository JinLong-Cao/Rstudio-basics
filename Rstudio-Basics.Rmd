## Introduction

Rstudio is a statistical programming language used to create models and plots.

## rstudio interface

```{r interface-image}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Rstudio_IDE_screenshot.png")
```

Rstudio interface can be broken down into 4 area.

* **Top Left**: Main "saved" file. The file, you're currently working on.
  + file examples: r script, r markdown, python, and many more. 
* **Top Right**:

## r setup

Ctrl+Alt+i = insert a new code chunk.

{r chunk-name, include=FALSE}\
\# code goes here\
\# include prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file.\
\# However, code in the chunk still runs and results can be used by other chunks.\
\# echo prevents code but results are still displayed.

First chunk of code will be used to setup rstudio packages and knitting settings. For example, **install.packages("tidyverse")**, after first installation of package, it is always ideal to comment (\#) it out to reduce runtime (so it does not have to download the package every time you run). **library(tidyverse)**, to use the packages, you are required to load it with library function.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
