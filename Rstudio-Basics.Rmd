## Introduction

Rstudio is a statistical programming language used to create models and plots.

## r setup

Ctrl+Alt+i = insert a new code chunk.

{r chunk-name, include=FALSE}\
\# code goes here\
\# include prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. However, code in the chunk still runs and results can be used by other chunks.\
\# echo prevents code but results are still displayed.


First chunk of code will be used to setup rstudio packages and knitting settings. Ex: install.packages("tidyverse"). After first installation of package, it is always ideal to comment (\#) it out to reduce runtime (so it does not have to download the package every time you run). To use the packages, you are required to load it with library function.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
