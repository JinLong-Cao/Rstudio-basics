## Introduction

Rstudio is a statistical programming language used to create models and plots.

## rstudio interface

```{r interface-image}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Rstudio_IDE_screenshot.png")
```

Rstudio interface can be broken down into 4 area.

* **Top Left**: The file, you're currently working on.
  + file examples: r script, r markdown, python, and many more. 
* **Top Right**: Includes Environment, History, Connection, Git, Tutorial. 
  + Environment: This is where all your variables, data, and values are displayed. 
  + History: History of code ran.
  + Git: Github connection.
    + Diff: Display the difference between your current file and the file on github.
    + Commit, pull, push: pull up to date file from github. Commit changes on current file to github. Push your committed changes to github. 
* **Bottom Left**: Includes Console, Terminal, Render, Background Jobs.
  + Console: The location of where code chucks are ran. Runs rstudio scripts.
  + Terminal: Command terminal 
  + Render: Knitting render location.
* **Bottom Right**: Includes Files, Plot, Packages, Help, Viewer, Presentation
  + Files: Display of your files.
  + Plots: Display of your plots.
  + Packages: List of Packages.
  + Help: When help(xyz) function is ran. Display information about xyz

## r setup

Ctrl+Alt+i = insert a new code chunk.

{r chunk-name, include=FALSE}\
\# code goes here\
\# include prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file.\
\# However, code in the chunk still runs and results can be used by other chunks.\
\# echo prevents code but results are still displayed.

First chunk of code will be used to setup rstudio packages and knitting settings. For example, **install.packages("tidyverse")**, after first installation of package, it is always ideal to comment (\#) it out to reduce runtime (so it does not have to download the package every time you run). **library(tidyverse)**, to use the packages, you are required to load it with library function.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r setup-image, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/setup-image.PNG")
```
